# CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
#This project takes input from the user, and then displays how much money they would have in interest per year, and the total money based on their inputs. 
It solves the problem from a hypothetical bank that wants to use this system to show student's the power of compounding interest.

#What did you do particularly well?
#I am happy with how nicely formated and neat the output of the code is. Along with how input verification is not limited to only rejecting numbers not in range.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
#I would enhance my code making the input validation into a function. Since it would be make "main" easier to read, and would've prevented any mistakes that could occur
from copying the code over and over.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
#The most difficult part to write was the second "for loop" that compounded the monthly interest that was occuring. With some guidance from stack overflow along with slowly thinking through the logic of how the math would work, I was able to properly create the loop.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
#I used classes along with mutator and accessor functions as the backbone of the project. Without them I wouldn't be able to accurately recieve and manipulate the data.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable
#By using classes, and using functions to free up main as much as possible, other programmers would be able to easily see what this program is intended to do and would be able to make modifications of their choosing if desired. One thing I could've done better was making the variables more clear on what they are meant to represent, such as switching from "oBalance" to "openBalance".
